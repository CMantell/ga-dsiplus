# How to Submit your HW 

After worksheets, we'll be using github to submit all HW:

1. Look in your class calendar for the HW due that week on Monday at 7 pm. The HW listed is the HW that's due that day 

2. At the top of the page, click on the "Issue" Navigation item (next to < > Code) 

3. Click on "New Issue" (Green button on the right hand side) 

4. Submit your HW and name your issue Location Firstname Lastname 

5. Someone from the outcomes team will give you feedback in the timeline listed on the HW assignment and will close your issue when you have received feedback. Keep an eye out in your email and github alerts. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us!
