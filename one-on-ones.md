# One-on-Ones and Office Hours 

We love meeting and talking with you, please don't be shy! 

One-on-One's are a safe space to talk about literally anything. One-on-Ones might include:
- Your previous work history 
- Goals for your future 
- Creating your job search strategy 
- Getting you past roadblocks 
- Follow up or networking strategies 
- Feedback on your materials 
- Emotional issues
- Generally shooting the breeze

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared!
